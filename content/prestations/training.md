Tailored interventions adapted to participantsâ€™ profiles.

## Training

In order to better understand the constantly evolving public policies, we offer customised training programs adapted to the profile of the participants and the time they can devote to them. We develop training programs in our areas of expertise: social protection, labor law, international standards & compliance, social news, economics of social protection, policy evaluation, etc.

**Pedagogy:**

* The training combines theoretical aspects and their practical implications, and exercises built around the professional context in which you operate can be proposed.
* We provide you with educational resources to go further.
* The training is evaluated "live" at the end of the session, then "cold", 60 days later, to validate the transfer of skills.

**Modalities:**

* In-person or online.
* Provision of an individual training certificate and a certificate of completion.

## Conferences, Round-tables and Webinars

Animations and interventions in conferences, roundtables, and webinars on current economic and social issues.

**Achievements:**

* Capacity-building workshop on social protection: construction and animation of the social security section of the workshop - online and on-site. Audience: members of a government and central administration.
* Interventions during seminars and web conferences on the theme of pension reform.
