We provide support for the design of policies and programs in the fields of social protection and labour law.

Social protection and labour law are interconnected, and our firm recognises this relationship. That's why we offer services for the elaboration, analysis, and evaluation of policies and programs, considering their various impacts, such as economic, societal, territorial, or environmental. Our comprehensive approach enables us to provide you with studies that offer a clear and rational understanding of the issues you face, empowering you to fully comprehend the legal, economic, social, and other stakes related to your projects.

We work with clients on a local level, including local authorities, businesses, non-governmental organisations, labour-management  and social protection organisations, as well as on an international level, including governments, development partners, civil society institutions, and others.
